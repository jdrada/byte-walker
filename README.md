# Byte Walker

Byte Walker is a simple yet powerful web crawler written in TypeScript, designed to efficiently crawl websites and generate detailed reports on the pages visited. This project is perfect for those looking to understand web crawling mechanics or as a starting point for more complex web scraping tasks.

## Features

- Crawls a website starting from a given base URL.
- Counts and tracks the number of visits to each page within the same domain.
- Generates a sorted report of visited pages in a human-readable format.
- Handles various edge cases and errors gracefully.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:
